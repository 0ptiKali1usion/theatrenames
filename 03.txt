So as soon as I started reading “The Hacker Perspective” I stopped. The author spoke of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, & Gallup’s Clifton StrengthsFinder assessments, & I had to find out what these were. I saw there was a pay version, & a free version. I had somebody try the free version, & it quickly seemed to be bullshit. So I hopped onto Google, & found codes for the pay version in less than 5 minutes (TY39QF69KD23DE47) on images.google.com (I also found the BP10 code: ESF-TT3NX-NB8G8). Upon completion, I continued reading. I appreciate the authors interpretation of the results, & I appreciate that I fit their profile of a “hacker”, but it’s bullshit. Anybody can be a hacker. All it takes is the ingenuity to be MacGuyver, the personality to be MaxHeadroom, the guts to be (Poor Mans) James Bond, the enthusiasm of Steve Wozniak, & the dedication of… of… of a fucking college student. Yup. WHATEVS! There is no recipe to be a hacker. The authors initial question of If Alice hacks the Gibson is she a hacker? If Bob copies Alice like a recipe to hack the Gibson is he a hacker? If Eve intercepts the recipe & hacks the Gibson is she a hacker? The answer is: they all are hackers! Cuz they’re wasting time hacking the Gibson instead of getting laid! Alice shows deduction skills, Bob shows ability to follow directions skills, & Eve shows thieving ability skills, all of which are required to be a successful haX0r. For the Record, the author states 1) Ideation 2) Strategic 3) Achiever 4) Relator & 5) Learner. I was 1) Strategic 2) Achiever 3) Communication (instead of relator, cuz I’m elite & should be lecturing) 4) Activator (instead of learner, cuz I’m elite & have already learned my ass off, & would rather get off my ass & get hacking) & 5) Ideation. So maybe the author is on to something. But I think anyone could have hacker monkey mind if they so desired, by putting in the time.
