Well here’s my new take on the Winter 2017/2018 issue of 2600 vol 34 #4

2600 is still raking Equifax over the coals, & rightfully so. With a provocative cover photo of what seems to be a depiction of the Equifax server room (maybe it’s the authentic server room?) with cracking floors & leaking information. The opening article “Credit Denial” is a typical state of the hacker community address speaking on the lack of progress in the privacy area of cyber security (or rather lack thereof cyber security?) & consumer protection. All of this is very true, & reeks of everything the EFF & Cypherpunks & 2600 have been saying… forever? It amazes me that no singular figure has stepped up to replace Ralph Nader & his “Raiders”, because this is the type of abuse Mr. Nader specialized in. Consumer abuse. Maybe, perhaps in the near future somebody will seize on this opportunity, but for now, it is up to consumers (& hackers) to keep themselves informed, & not fall victim to abuse. Well, Christopher Elliott seems to be a known consumer advocate, but everyone will confuse him with the awesome actor. Plus, what’s his gang going to be called, “Elliott’s Smelliotts”? My advice would be to read the fine print (like when Equifax stated if you use their website you waive your right to sue!), don’t share personal information at all costs, try & make sure everything you use for communications is encrypted, or at least secured, & avoid doing business with organizations that have had data breaches in the past. There’s probably better advice out there, like go “off the grid”. Whatevs.

In 1997 these 14 entities were trying to secure information (notice, Equifax is one of them):
Acxiom Corporation, CDB Infotek, DCS Information Systems, Database Technologies Inc., Equifax Credit Information Services Inc., Experian, First Data Solutions Inc., Information America Inc., IRSC Inc., Lexis-Nexis, the Metromail Corporation, the National Fraud Center, Online Professional Electronic Network and the Trans Union Corporation
http://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/18/us/a-plan-for-database-privacy-but-public-has-to-ask-for-it.html

Most, if not all of these databases still exist, & blackhat hackers know this, & target them all the time. Even right here in Tucson, AZ CardSystems Solutions left 40 million Visa & MasterCard accounts wide open for compromise. Of course we all remember the Heartland Payment Systems hack Alberto Gonzalez masterminded affecting 130 million accounts. So new databases are appearing & disappearing in conjunction with the original big 14. Like fish in a barrel, we all are. (maybe I should have said “Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering”. Nah.) 

When Geraldo Rivera’s & Julia Robert’s personal credit information was compromised in the early nineties by blackhat hacker gangs, it was stated that AT&T’s database was compromised (book: MOD, The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace), but Information America (among others) were constantly experiencing compromised accounts, that made obtaining this type of information trivial. & it still is trivial, if you know the right people, & offer the right things, or guess the right passwords. Feel safe? Where’s Ralph Nader when we need him!? Somebody needs to make a call for new regulation regarding “private” consumer records. Until that happens, it is up to us whitehat hackers to protect systems to the very best of our abilities, & continue to stay one step ahead of the blackhat hackers when possible (if possible).

*please excuse any unnecessary soapbox type commentary. The opening 2600 article always brings it outta me.

Of course I enjoyed the “Using dnscat2 for Encrypted C&C over DNS” article, because I enjoy penetration testing & actual internet hacking articles. With that said, dnscat2 w/C&C is very powerful for remote control of a compromised machine. The use of DNS communications channels makes for a stealthy & reliable way to go about it. Any competent sysadmin should be actively looking for this type of traffic on their network, & if they are not, they deserve to be pwned by a clever haX0r. THEY DESERVE IT! Well, maybe not. Anyways… This article should be an easy to follow & execute method for even amateur penetration testers.
________________________________________________________________________________

I enjoyed “Educating Friends & Family About Online Security” & I appreciate the articles aim/goal, but I do have a few problems, or additions rather. The author advises people to use “HTTPS Everywhere” & “Tor”, but it helps to point out “Tor” is not the end all be all for anonymity, & to point out documents like: https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en#warning this page explains the DOs & DON’Ts of Tor. If your “friend or family” installs insecure plug-ins for example, that’s no bueno. Another thing to consider are the examples provided. The author points out that “credit/financial, medical, & porn browsing personal data are best kept private, & anyone can appreciate that. But I know people with no financial/medical history (they got porn history, of course, but they don’t care) so they remain jaded. But tell them that the Tucson Police Department pays $300.00 to anybody willing to NARC out a drug dealer, or pimp, & they start to think about security & privacy (whom sees & knows what). Perhaps suggest using codes, discretion, & anonymity (or at least act like you are joking when talking about “privileged information” so that there is plausible deniability for all parties). The author should make it a point to consider/contemplate your friends & family on a personal level, & use critical thinking skills to manipulate these poor souls into taking their digital security seriously. Social engineering can be used for good, but only SE when no other options sink in. Slacking on personal privacy puts not only yourself, but also everyone you communicate with at risk.
________________________________________________________________________________

 I believe “Creating Strong and Easy to Remember Passwords” is a useful article. I can’t say I’m aware of this authors exact password “hashing” technique (I can’t name it like “XKCD Scheme”, “Phonetic Muscle Memory”, or “PAO Method”), but people (like Bruce Schneier for example) have been recommending techniques like this for years. I appreciate the authors brevity (one page article) because even tho this may be old news for some readers, it may not be for others, & still, it should make us all stop, pause, & consider our own personal password habits for at least a… moment.
________________________________________________________________________________

“Don’t You Have a Smartwatch Yet? It Will Make Your Email Security That Much Easier to Deal With” should be given credit for a descriptive title for sure! For example, when I read “What Happens When WHOIS Data is Made Public” on the next page (next 3rd page to be precise) I wondered “what’s in store?” With that said, this smartwatch article makes me want a smartwatch. Hopefully I purchase a cheap & secure smartwatch soon. Hopefully a 301PB is secure, & functional, cuz it seems to be the cheapest out there. Ok, I’ll end this synopsis by saying “I didn’t know I could like, tether a smartwatch to my cellphone, like a secondary display.” Doesn’t that sound cool? I’m such a smartwatch newb. Oh, & there’s a typo that says “sting” instead of “string”. Moving on…
________________________________________________________________________________

At first, I thought this 2600: The Hacker Quarterly’s edition of “Telecom Informer” was going to be pointless. Merely an article to make one ponder technology, telecommunications, politics, & capitalism. But then The Profit finally ties these thing together at the end to describe how the loss of Net Neutrality legislation will affect rural communities in the United States of America. Enjoy!
________________________________________________________________________________

In “What Happens When WHOIS Data Is Made Public” the author basically describes the SMS, Email, & Phone call based SPAM they receive when they neglect to use a WHOIS cloaking service. They also describe plans for the next generation implementation of a gated type of WHOIS service (RDS). And that is all. I have a few personal additions to make on this article. WHOIS is akin to domains, what Finger was to users, a directory of contact information. Finger is virtually nonexistent on a remote “port 79” basis, while still applicable on local *nix machines, whereas WHOIS remains a remotely accessible resource for all, indexing all registered internet domains. Anyone that has ever read up on “foot printing” techniques (phase 1 of penetration testing) should be well aware of the fantastic uses WHOIS provides a nefarious computer user, but seeing the effects of actual SPAM is insightful. Unfortunately, the author did not explain about the “snail mail” SPAM one receives from accurate WHOIS data. I used to receive all kinds of offers from competing Domain Registrars attempting to trick me into renewing my domain name with them, saying that my domain name would be expiring soon & that I MUST renew. It would have been interesting to see what the author thought of those social engineering/phishing attempts. Also, the concept of a “gated” WHOIS is flawed. We all know that everything from WiFi APs, to coupon codes, to porn site passwords get shared, & put into publicly accessible databases Why wouldn’t this happen with a gated WHOIS service? Answer: it would happen, stupid idea. Moving on… Oh! Almost forgot. I was researching how to contact a manufacturer in order to obtain goods for resale at a wholesale price. When I searched Google with the email addresses associated to the domain’s WHOIS record, I found them in databases like “www.mysql-password.com” where they had been pre-hashed for cracking purposes. Interesting? Maybe.
________________________________________________________________________________

“Deauthing the Neighbors, or Ring Theory” provides much food for thought in regards to WiFi guerrilla warfare, & I’ll leave it at that. (my neighbors could potentially read this & I’m not going to provide them with voluntary evidence!)
________________________________________________________________________________
*SPOILER ALERT!* (this article tells a personal account that reads like a story. I will be exposing “spoilers”. If you plan on reading this for enjoyment, read the article first, then read this.)
 
I have mixed feelings about “Nightmare On E Street (Modem and Me Against the World)”. At first I thought the article was fake, meaning that it is a work of fiction, written by a skilled hacker & amateur writer attempting to tell a story, that has (had?) a point. Point being that getting pwned can raise a n00bs skills to higher levels. I thought I would get to the end, & the author would have discovered that their personal computer had been backdoored, hence explaining why all the router/modem based security methods had failed, & (re)installed a new OS fixing the problem… But that didn’t happen. Then I thought the author would learn from this experience, set up a Raspberry Pi based (N)IDS, & learn to be a proper sysadmin… But that didn’t happen! This article goes over SOME good material (various DDoS attacks, various facts about WiFi technology & physics, a book I’d never heard of called “Hate Crimes in Cyberspace”), and details the experiences, & exactly what it feels like for an intelligent person lacking in cyber skills to get pwned. But ultimately I find myself thinking “I’ve sent articles@2600.com better stuff than this that was never printed/published. What gives?”. Perhaps this IS a work of (non)fiction, & readers are being prompted (expected?) to send in suggestions/solutions along the lines of “reinstall your operating system & setup an IDS”. Perhaps? Whatever the case may be, it is a story, & it is kinda fun to read, but it could use a better ending I think.

So as soon as I started reading “The Hacker Perspective” I stopped. The author spoke of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, & Gallup’s Clifton StrengthsFinder assessments, & I had to find out what these were. I saw there was a pay version, & a free version. I had somebody try the free version, & it quickly seemed to be bullshit. So I hopped onto Google, & found codes for the pay version in less than 5 minutes (TY39QF69KD23DE47) on images.google.com (I also found the BP10 code: ESF-TT3NX-NB8G8). Upon completion, I continued reading. I appreciate the authors interpretation of the results, & I appreciate that I fit their profile of a “hacker”, but it’s bullshit. Anybody can be a hacker. All it takes is the ingenuity to be MacGuyver, the personality to be MaxHeadroom, the guts to be (Poor Mans) James Bond, the enthusiasm of Steve Wozniak, & the dedication of… of… of a fucking college student. Yup. WHATEVS! I dunno. There is no recipe to be a hacker! The authors initial question of If Alice hacks the Gibson is she a hacker? If Bob copies Alice like a recipe to hack the Gibson is he a hacker? If Eve intercepts the recipe & hacks the Gibson is she a hacker? The answer is: they all are hackers! Cuz they’re wasting time hacking the Gibson, instead of wasting time trying to get laid! Alice shows deduction skills, Bob shows ability to follow directions skills, & Eve shows thieving ability skills, all of which are required to be a successful haX0r (at some point for sure). For the Record, the author states (1) Ideation (2) Strategic (3) Achiever (4) Relator & (5) Learner. I was (1) Strategic (2) Achiever (3) Communication (instead of Relator, cuz I’m elite & should be lecturing rather than relating) (4) Activator (instead of Learner, cuz I have already learned, & would rather get off my ass & get hacking. NOW!) & (5) Ideation. So maybe the author is on to something. But I think anyone could have hacker monkey mind (getting around boundaries/obstacles) if they so desire, by putting in the time.

“Quantum Computers and Bitcoin” is awesome! When the author wrote the article, 16 qubits was an exciting prospect. As of December 13th, 2017 a 20 qubit system is ready for testing, while a 50 qubit system looms on the horizon http://www.zdnet.com/article/ferrari-ai-partnership-will-fundamentally-change-sports-broadcasts-intel-ces/ BUT! As of today 01/10/2018 Intel has already revealed details regarding it’s new 49 qubit system called “Tangle Lake” at CES in Las Vegas https://www.extremetech.com/computing/261734-intel-unveils-new-quantum-computer-declares-quantum-breakthrough & IBM has displayed the guts of it’s 50 qubit system https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/09/this-is-what-a-50-qubit-quantum-computer-looks-like/ SO! WOW! HOLY COW! The author of this article predicted 49 qubit quantum computing would hit in over ten years… What a fast decade it was! Is that right? Do I know what I’m writing about? Maybe not, you look it up! I don’t have access to this technology, so I don’t know what to think, but there’s a picture of the 49 qubit machine here: https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/hardware/intels-49qubit-chip-aims-for-quantum-supremacy  The author also states that once a 256 qubit based quantum computer becomes available, the Bitcoin algorithm will cease to be viable (at that point, all current encryption methods will be obsolete I’d guess, cuz they’ll get cracked like a hot knife through butter). Kodak released a Bitcoin mining machine at CES for $3,400.00 that’ll rake in an estimated $375.00 per month http://www.zdnet.com/article/kodak-bitcoin-miner-on-display-at-ces-2018/ What does all this mean to me? Not much, I don’t even know if I’m getting the facts right! I dunno. Fact is tho, I didn’t know about any of this until I read this article & started looking up news. I remember back in the 1990s when quantum computing & cryptocurrency were science fiction. I’m glad to still be alive. Oh, & the author also theorizes/predicts what kind of restrictions/control measures might be put in place on/against quantum computing. So scifi, whoa.
________________________________________________________________________________

All I can really say about the “I Want To Be a Hacker” article, is that it’s basically a checklist for anyone considering becoming a professional paid whitehat hacker/Information Security/Penitration Tester. All of the suggestions should be considered using critical thinking skills (meaning figure out what applies to you personally, & do or don’t do those things). The opportunities for a wannabe pro-hacker in this World are better than they have ever been. So take advantage, & read this article.

“EFFecting Digital Freedom: NSA Spying Is Up for Re-Election” is about how all the creepy stuff the NSA does, that Edward Snowden exposed to the World, is legal. Legal until Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Acts expires (Already did over a week ago actually). The subject of renewal is still currently being debated: http://www.weeklystandard.com/surveillance-state-fisa-and-the-section-702-fight/article/2011087 Senators such as Rand Paul, Ron Wyden, Patrick Leahy, Mike Lee, & Steve Daines are calling for discussion, slowing down reauthorization, & shooting down the “Burr Bill” spoken about in this article. While Cotton, Risch, Rubio, Collins, Blunt, Lankford, Cornyn, McCain, Tillis, Roberts, Graham, Then, Perdue, & Burr want to just attach it. At least I think that’s how it’s going down. https://www.c-span.org/video/?438781-1/senators-call-slowing-fisa-reauthorization https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1297/text Don’t ask me, ask the EFF, or read www.congress.gov if you can decipher it (I can’t)… WAIT A SECOND! It’s not that difficult, just go to the link in the article: https://www.eff.org/702-spying

“Conventionalist Theory of Reference in Comparison to Programming Language” reminds me of Autumn’s (previous issue) article “Obfuscating Biopolitics: A Theoretical Primer for Cyborgs and Other Concerned Citizens”. What I’m trying to say is basically, somebody sent their homework to articles@2600.com & got it published. Both articles read like term papers, & they more than likely were. If you actually want to know more about Gareth Evens, go to YouTube search for Language and Creativity. It’s a lot of philosophical stuff spoken with a British accent I can barely comprehend (Australian accents are tough for me too). I’m not sure if they explain Conventionalist vs Causal theories, but hey, if you actually care about this you should enjoy the videos anyway. I looked up Conventionalism & Causal_theory_of_reference on Wikipedia to jog my memory, & came to the conclusion that the author made a valiant effort to make their comparison of javascript to spoken language make sense in regards to these “theories”, & probably baffled their instructor netting them a passing grade. The points seem to be proven, but, damn, it’s a painful read for me. Language is so very arbitrary, spoken or coded, it is all created by humans, making zeros & ones, and uttered syllables into meaningful information in a given context. Speaking of syllables, I should read SnowCrash again…
________________________________________________________________________________

I do believe “Down and Out in a Land of Script Kiddies (or How I Learned to Stop Phreaking and Love Ma Bell)” is a work of poetry. If I’m not mistaken. It makes a comparison between the years 1992 & 2017 (25 years apart) specifically in regards to the computer underground & digital freedom. Seeing as how it is art, all I can say is read it & form your own opinion. Personally, I think their depiction of 1992 is framed in a positive, nostalgic picture frame, while 2017 is framed in a more paranoid, dystopian view. 1992 & 2017 don’t seem that different to me in terms of technology, it’s society & culture that has changed the most. Want me to explain? To break it down for you? You know you do. LOL.
If you ask me (I think you did, didn’t you?) the author is suffering from 21st Century Schizoid Man Syndrome. Spending so much time & effort romanticizing the past, they neglect to adjust to the future, or now rather. The phrase “I’m a dying breed” shows the unwillingness to evolve, & the persistence to stay the same, in a changing World. Rather than adapt, the author begs to “break free”, “unplug from my electronic shackles”, giving up altogether rather than use their wisdom to enlighten a new breed of “wares kids”. Perhaps the author means to be pathetic, demonstrating the way nostalgia can paralyze, & ultimately destroy human progress. They speak of $900.00 video cards in a negative context, but back in 1992, $900.00 was just a drop in the bucket to a pirate, considering a gigabyte of disk space was worth $4000.00 http://www.mkomo.com/cost-per-gigabyte They speak of red boxing for unlimited long distance, when today most long distance phone calls are free, no need to break any laws. They speak of Usenet trawling, when now usenet has been ruined by bogus posts perpetrated by greedy spammers seeking to lure people into payperclick advertisements & malware infected bogusware. Now warez kids turn to web forums for discussion, finding & posting links to file hosting sites with cryptic hashing algorithm based URLs. The author speaks of cDc & DEF CON black hats, when now Anonymous & LULzSEC are the black hats, & DEF CON (& Black Hat) attendees are the white hats. Speaking of DikuMUD instead of WoW. Speaking of PGP encoding rather than GPG encoding. Speaking of 14.4kbps modems & CAT5 instead of WiFi & 4G. Speaking of ANSI graphics instead of Memes. Need I go on? Ok I will. Speaking of datamining as if the Masters of Deception & Legion of Doom didn’t run rampant through datemining type agencies like Information America & LexisNexis. These days when data breaches occur, at least the public is informed & understands. We can take proactive measures to secure what we can rather than cower in fear of “hackers”, confused, & desperate for law enforcement to perform another “crackdown”. Speaking of 1.2 trillion digital circuits in one square inch of CPU as if that’s a bad thing (is that truly tyrus568’s point? Everything in 2017 is BAD compared to 1992 where all is GOOD, right? How can cheaper more powerful hardware be BAD?). Yes this work of art, this piece of poetry MUST be about a nostalgic fool, unwilling, or perhaps, unable to change. Obviously driven mad by the paranoia of software piracy (encrypting hard drives, scrubbing history, VPN tunneling). Yes, when one is committing crimes, paranoia will ultimately drive them insane. Perhaps in 1992 the author felt that their skills were so 31337, that they could never be caught, or perhaps that everyone elses skills were so k-lame that they all remained clueless neophytes to the crimes being committed. But now, the authors lack of confidence in themselves, & the awareness of surveillance state technology implemented everywhere, now the only way to retain freedom is to “let go of the system”. Wow. Heavy man. P@ss th3 b0ng d00d.

Want to know how to verify the integrity of a binary contained in a Linux distribution? Then “Dispelling a Breach Rumor” is the one page article for you!
________________________________________________________________________________

Well, I said I was going to build a PI-Hole, & I did. It was quick, easy, & effective. Just like last issue’s “Citizen Engineer” said it would be. This issue is urging me to build an MP3 device that is patent-free, license-free, & open source. Great, now I need a few more dollars for hardware. Hmm? Maybe I can sell my Raspberry Pi! However I manage to come up with the money, I will be referencing this article that speaks on: Adafruit, Helix, Apache Mynewt, Zephyr, RTL SDR, OpenKinect, TinyUSB, Fernvale, MD380, &  Scanlime. If this doesn’t sound fun to you, I’m assuming you’re not a hardware person, or that you’re such a hardware person that you’ve already done this.
________________________________________________________________________________

I am not going to comment on “THE RUSSIAN HACKING DIATRIBE, AND WHY IT IS COMPLETE AGITPROP NONSENSE (AND, NO, I’M NOT A TRUMP SUPPORTER)” because the title speaks for itself. I personally have no opinion on this as well. I still believe in the American notion/law of the Presumption of Innocence, or rather ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat (the burden of proof is on the one who declares, not on one who denies). If you can prove that the Russian Gov’t is committing cybercrimes, I will know that the Russian Gov’t is committing cybercrimes. I am not a FED, I don’t have access to NSA monitoring equipment, & Russia is not on trial, so I have no opinion. The author has done research on the topic it seems.
________________________________________________________________________________

Want to know the underlying theory behind being a Network Ninja? In one page or less?? “Successful Network Attacks - Phase Five: Covering Tracks” will explain. I say “theory” because this article is not about tools, techniques, or commands, it is about the systems that needs to be manipulated in order to “cover ones tracks” once unauthorized access has been gained on/to a network. If the concept of altering log files, & obfuscating originating addresses sounds foreign to you, I guess you need to read this.
